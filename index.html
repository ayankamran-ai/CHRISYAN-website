        <p class="full-text" style="display:none;">
          Compelling Headline: The headline should attract attention and clearly indicate what the article is about, often incorporating a primary keyword or promising a benefit (e.g., "10 Tips," "How to Guide").
Strong Introduction: This paragraph should hook the reader's interest and introduce the main argument or topic, showcasing why the reader should continue reading.
Structured Body: The main content develops the points. In modern articles, using subheadings, short paragraphs (2-3 sentences), bullet points, and numbered lists is crucial for readability and scannability, especially on mobile devices.
Visuals and Media: Incorporating relevant images, infographics, or videos helps break up text, improves engagement, and can simplify complex information.
Facts and Research: Support your claims with statistics, quotes, or short stories to build authority and trustworthiness (E-E-A-T - Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness).
Clear Conclusion: Summarize the main points and leave the reader with a clear impression or a call to action (CTA), guiding them on the next steps, such as signing up for a newsletter or exploring more content. 
The Writing Process
Select a Topic & Audience: Choose a topic you are passionate about and identify who you are writing for to tailor your tone and style effectively.
Research & Outline: Gather facts and quotes, then create an outline to structure your ideas logically.
Write a Rough Draft: Focus on getting your ideas down without worrying about perfection. You can edit later.
Edit and Refine: Read your article aloud to catch errors and improve flow. Ensure it's concise, error-free, and adheres to modern best practices like mobile optimization. 
By following these steps, you can create engaging and valuable content that resonates with modern audiences.

        <h4>My Best Friend</h4>
        <p class="short-text">A best friend is someone who supports us...</p>
        <p class="full-text" style="display:none;">
          A best friend is not just someone you talk to; they are the person who
          understands your silence. For me, that person is [Friend's Name]. Our 
          friendship isn't built on grand gestures but on the small, consistent
          moments—the late-night conversations, the shared laughter over inside
          jokes, and the unwavering support during difficult times.
          What makes [Friend's Name] my best friend is their genuine nature.
          They are the first person I call when I have good news and the first 
          person to offer a shoulder when things go wrong. They have an incredible
          ability to listen without judgment and provide honesty even when it’s 
          hard to hear. Whether we are exploring new places or just sitting in 
          comfortable silence, their presence makes every experience better.
          In a world that is constantly changing, having a constant friend like
          [Friend's Name] is a rare gift. They have taught me the true meaning of
          loyalty and kindness. I am incredibly grateful for our bond and know that
          no matter where life takes us in the future, we will always find our way
          back to the friendship that defines who we are today.

        <p class="full-text" style="display:none;">
          Dear Ali,I am writing to formally request a sick leave for two
          days, starting from [Start Date] to [End Date], as I have developed 
          a high fever and persistent cough. My physician has advised me to
          take complete bed rest and medication to ensure a swift recovery
          before returning to my professional duties. I have ensured that my
          current high-priority tasks are either completed or handed over to
         [Colleague's Name], who has kindly agreed to handle any urgent matters
         in my absence. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this 
         short-notice request and will keep you updated on my recovery status.
